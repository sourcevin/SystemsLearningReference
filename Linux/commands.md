```
The setuid/setguid permissions are used to tell the system to run an executable as the owner with the owner\'s permissions.
Be careful using setuid/setgid bits in permissions. If you incorrectly assign permissions to a file owned by root with the setuid/setgid bit set, then you can open your system to intrusion.
You can only assign the setuid/setgid bit by explicitly defining permissions. The character for the setuid/setguid bit is s.
So do set the setuid/setguid bit on file2.sh you would issue the command chmod g+s file2.sh.
```

```
The sticky bit can be very useful in shared environment because when it has been assigned to the permissions on a directory it sets it so only file owner can rename or delete the said file.
You can only assign the sticky bit by explicitly defining permissions. The character for the sticky bit is t.
To set the sticky bit on a directory named dir1 you would issue the command chmod +t dir1.
